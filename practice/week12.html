    <h1>Star wars is SO COOL</h1>
    <button class="accordion">The Galactic Conflict</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the galaxy was torn apart by a conflict between the light and
            dark sides of the Force. The Rebel Alliance, led by heroes like Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, stood
            against the oppressive Galactic Empire, ruled by the dark Sith Lord, Emperor Palpatine. This epic battle for
            freedom and justice would determine the fate of countless star systems.</p>

    <button class="accordion">The Mystical Force</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The Force is a mysterious and powerful energy that binds all living things together. Jedi Knights, like
            Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, used the Force for knowledge and defense, embodying the light side. Meanwhile, the
            Sith, such as Darth Vader, sought to dominate the galaxy through the dark side, using their power for
            destruction and control. The Force's duality represents the eternal struggle between good and evil.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Legacy of Star Wars</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Star Wars is more than a storyâ€”it's a cultural phenomenon. With iconic characters, breathtaking space
            battles, and timeless lessons about courage, redemption, and hope, the saga continues to inspire generations
            of fans. From the original trilogy to new stories in the Disney era, Star Wars reminds us that even in the
            darkest of times, hope can ignite like a spark in the galaxy.</p>
