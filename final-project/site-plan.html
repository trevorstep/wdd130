        <b>Introduction</b>
        <p></p>
        Welcome to Trevor’s Tech Portfolio
Hey, thanks for stopping by! I created this site to give you an inside look at who I am, what I can bring to your team, and, most importantly, what I’ve been building in my journey through computer science. I want this to be a straightforward place where future employers, collaborators, and even like-minded developers can get to know what drives me, see my dedication to my projects, and explore what I’ve been able to accomplish.
<p></p>
This site is more than a resume – it’s a story of where I’ve been, what I’m working on now, and what I’m aiming for next. Each project and experience listed here showcases the skills, drive, and attention to detail that I bring to my work. Take a look around; there’s a lot to see!
<p></p>
Why This Site Exists: My Mission for the Portfolio
<p></p>

I made this site with a specific purpose: to stand out. I want anyone who’s thinking about hiring me to see clearly why I’m worth their consideration. Sure, you could read about me on a LinkedIn profile, but I think there’s a huge advantage in seeing all my accomplishments in one streamlined place where I control the narrative.
<p></p>

I’m a computer science student, but more than that, I’m an up-and-coming software developer with a hunger for real-world applications. I’m someone who loves to problem-solve, especially in areas like algorithm optimization, efficient coding practices, and understanding complex systems. I also take pride in tackling challenges head-on, even if that means spending extra time on a project until it’s not just finished, but right.
<p></p>

What You’ll Find Here
<p></p>

1. About Me
<p></p>

You’ll find a section on my background, including my journey in computer science so far, my education, and a bit about my interests outside of coding. My goal here is to give you insight into who I am as a person and developer. I’m committed to growth, and I’m all about the grind – whether it’s pushing through challenging classes, learning a new language, or developing in-depth projects.

<p></p>
2.Projects
<p></p>

This is the heart of the site, where you’ll get a look at what I’ve been working on, from software projects to hands-on hardware builds. The projects here span a range of skills and areas, each showcasing different aspects of my expertise and curiosity.

Each project page will give you a breakdown of its purpose, my approach, the tools and languages used, and what I learned along the way. This includes:
<p></p>

<b> Software Projects </b>
<p></p>

You’ll find various software applications and coding projects that demonstrate my programming skills, primarily in C#. These range from complex algorithms and data structures to search and sorting methods, which show my analytical and logical abilities in action.
<p></p>

Web Development Projects
<p></p>

Since web development is part of my curriculum, I’m continually honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve included examples of websites I’ve built, complete with creative layouts and interactive features.
<p></p>

 Hardware Projects
<p></p>

I’m also diving into hardware, working on projects with tools like Arduino. These hands-on builds have challenged me to merge programming skills with real-world applications.

Each project here is documented with screenshots, code snippets, and clear explanations. I want employers to understand my versatility as a developer, capable of taking on both software and hardware challenges.
<p></p>

 Technical Skills
<p></p>

I’ll outline the programming languages, frameworks, and tools I’m familiar with. As a developer, I know my strengths, but I’m also honest about what I’m still working on. I think this transparency is essential because it shows that I’m aware of my limitations, but I’m constantly looking to improve.

<p></p>
4. Contact Information
<p></p>

At the end of the day, this site is also here to encourage connections. I want to make it easy for employers to reach out directly or find me on professional platforms like GitHub, where you can see the source code of my projects in more depth. I’ll provide links and direct contact information here for easy access.
<p></p>

<p></p>
Why Come to My Site?
There are plenty of sites out there for potential employers to explore, but this site is designed with you in mind. My goal is to save you time and give you an accurate picture of my work ethic, attention to detail, and technical skills. I don’t just list what I’ve done; I provide context, so you can understand the thought process behind my work and see how I handle complex problems.
<p></p>

Beyond technical proficiency, I think what sets me apart is the way I approach challenges. I’m committed to learning and not afraid to get into the details – which, for an employer, means you’re getting someone who won’t back down just because a project is difficult.
<p></p>

What Will You Get Out of This?
My hope is that anyone who visits this site leaves with a clear understanding of my dedication to this field. I want future employers to see that I’m not only skilled but ready to hit the ground running. For collaborators, this site will show the depth of my commitment to my projects and help us determine if we’re a good fit to work together.
<p></p>

I’m continuously updating this site as I learn new skills, take on more challenging projects, and expand my knowledge. So, this is a site you’ll want to check back on if you’re interested in seeing my progress.
<p></p>
Thanks again for visiting – I hope you find what you’re looking for and leave with a solid idea of how I might be a valuable addition to your team. If anything here catches your interest, don’t hesitate to reach out!
