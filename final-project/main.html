                Introduction

                <p>
                    Welcome to Trevor’s Tech Portfolio
                    Hey, thanks for stopping by! I created this site to give you an inside look at who I am, what I can
                    bring to your
                    team, and, most importantly, what I’ve been building in my journey through computer science. I want
                    this to be a
                    straightforward place where future employers, collaborators, and even like-minded developers can get
                    to know what
                    drives me, see my dedication to my projects, and explore what I’ve been able to accomplish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site is more than a resume – it’s a story of where I’ve been, what I’m working on now, and what
                    I’m aiming
                    for next. Each project and experience listed here showcases the skills, drive, and attention to
                    detail that I
                    bring to my work. Take a look around; there’s a lot to see!
                </p>

                <p>Why This Site Exists: My Mission for the Portfolio
                </p>

                <p>
                    I made this site with a specific purpose: to stand out. I want anyone who’s thinking about hiring me
                    to see
                    clearly why I’m worth their consideration. Sure, you could read about me on a LinkedIn profile, but
                    I think
                    there’s a huge advantage in seeing all my accomplishments in one streamlined place where I control
                    the narrative.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m a computer science student, but more than that, I’m an up-and-coming software developer with a
                    hunger for
                    real-world applications. I’m someone who loves to problem-solve, especially in areas like algorithm
                    optimization,
                    efficient coding practices, and understanding complex systems. I also take pride in tackling
                    challenges head-on,
                    even if that means spending extra time on a project until it’s not just finished, but right.

                    What You’ll Find Here
                </p>

                <p>
                    1. About Me
                </p>

                <p>
                    You’ll find a section on my background, including my journey in computer science so far, my
                    education, and a bit
                    about my interests outside of coding. My goal here is to give you insight into who I am as a person
                    and developer.
                    I’m committed to growth, and I’m all about the grind – whether it’s pushing through challenging
                    classes, learning
                    a new language, or developing in-depth projects.
                </p>

                    4. Contact Information
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the end of the day, this site is also here to encourage connections. I want to make it easy for
                    employers to
                    reach out directly or find me on professional platforms like GitHub, where you can see the source
                    code
                    of my
                    projects in more depth. I’ll provide links and direct contact information here for easy access.

                    Why Come to My Site?
                    There are plenty of sites out there for potential employers to explore, but this site is designed
                    with you in
                    mind. My goal is to save you time and give you an accurate picture of my work ethic, attention to
                    detail, and
                    technical skills. I don’t just list what I’ve done; I provide context, so you can understand the
                    thought process
                    behind my work and see how I handle complex problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond technical proficiency, I think what sets me apart is the way I approach challenges. I’m
                    committed to
                    learning and not afraid to get into the details – which, for an employer, means you’re getting
                    someone who won’t
                    back down just because a project is difficult.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What Will You Get Out of This?
                    My hope is that anyone who visits this site leaves with a clear understanding of my dedication to
                    this field. I
                    want future employers to see that I’m not only skilled but ready to hit the ground running. For
                    collaborators,
                    this site will show the depth of my commitment to my projects and help us determine if we’re a good
                    fit to work
                    together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m continuously updating this site as I learn new skills, take on more challenging projects, and
                    expand my
                    knowledge. So, this is a site you’ll want to check back on if you’re interested in seeing my
                    progress.
                </p>
