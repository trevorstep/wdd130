                    <h1>Welcome to my Tech Portfolio!!</h1>
                    <p>Hey, thanks for stopping by!</p>
                    <p>I created this site to give you an inside look at who I am, what I can
                        bring to your
                        team, and, most importantly, what I’ve been building in my journey through computer science. I
                        want
                        this to be a
                        straightforward place where future employers, collaborators, and even like-minded developers can
                        get
                        to know what
                        drives me, see my dedication to my projects, and explore what I’ve been able to accomplish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This site is more than a resume – it’s a story of where I’ve been, what I’m working on now, and
                        what
                        I’m aiming
                        for next. Each project and experience listed here showcases the skills, drive, and attention to
                        detail that I
                        bring to my work. Take a look around; there’s a lot to see!

                    <h2>My Mission for this Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>
                        I made this site with a specific purpose: to stand out. I want anyone who’s thinking about
                        hiring me
                        to see
                        clearly why I’m worth their consideration. Sure, you could read about me on a LinkedIn profile,
                        but
                        I think
                        there’s a huge advantage in seeing all my accomplishments in one streamlined place where I
                        control
                        the narrative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m a computer science student, but more than that, I’m an up-and-coming software developer with
                        a
                        hunger for
                        real-world applications. I’m someone who loves to problem-solve, especially in areas like
                        algorithm
                        optimization,
                        efficient coding practices, and understanding complex systems. I also take pride in tackling
                        challenges head-on,
                        even if that means spending extra time on a project until it’s not just finished, but right.

                    <h2>
                        Why Come to My Site?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of sites out there for potential employers to explore, but this site is
                        designed
                        with you in
                        mind. My goal is to save you time and give you an accurate picture of my work ethic, attention
                        to
                        detail, and
                        technical skills. I don’t just list what I’ve done; I provide context, so you can understand the
                        thought process
                        behind my work and see how I handle complex problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond technical proficiency, I think what sets me apart is the way I approach challenges. I’m
                        committed to
                        learning and not afraid to get into the details – which, for an employer, means you’re getting
                        someone who won’t
                        back down just because a project is difficult.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What Will You Get Out of This?
                        My hope is that anyone who visits this site leaves with a clear understanding of my dedication
                        to
                        this field. I
                        want future employers to see that I’m not only skilled but ready to hit the ground running. For
                        collaborators,
                        this site will show the depth of my commitment to my projects and help us determine if we’re a
                        good
                        fit to work
                        together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m continuously updating this site as I learn new skills, take on more challenging projects,
                        and
                        expand my
                        knowledge. So, this is a site you’ll want to check back on if you’re interested in seeing my
                        progress.
                    </p>
